00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,580
previously on Heroes ...

2
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:04,837
Peter  I am your brother

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,917
you give me hunger you made me a monster

4
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:08,606
you want to make sure I am just like you 

5
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:11,368
they want to create a world fill with dangerous people

6
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,372
they will destroy everything

7
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:15,817
Dad.   come give your father a hug

8
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:18,427
you don't have your powders any more, Peter 

9
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,728
cause i have them now

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,610
you're...a monster

11
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,230
I wish you haven't said that 

12
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:28,050
we need your help

13
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,000
we should be grateful since we have each other

14
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,462
are you sure there is no side effect

15
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,713
we came to you for help

16
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,663
what have you done to us

17
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,407
we are not finished yet

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,409
pull the triger

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,241
you can fight him

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,068
that was fun

21
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,314
show is over

22
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,364
what is it

23
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:06,704
i'm not sure but i have definitely seen this card before

24
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:08,073
you're going to Africa

25
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:10,255
precog. he sees the future.

26
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:11,992
whatever he paints comes true

27
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,192
my boss can't let someone like that out there

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,130


29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200


30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,900


31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,290


32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,390


33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,100


34
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,170


35
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,273
Evil forces gather.

36
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,175
The dark sun rises.

37
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,344
Soon it will be too late.

38
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:56,913
Will you choose your own path

39
00:01:57,014 --> 00:02:00,784
Or will you have it chosen for you?

40
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,597
You've ruined everything.

41
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:14,631
Don't come any closer.

42
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:18,735
What the hell happened in here?

43
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,712
I'm trying to help maya to remove her ability.

44
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:24,499
So you knock us out?

45
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,576
You experiment on us?

46
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,745
Your abilities are synthetic.

47
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,447
They may hold the key to creating a cure.

48
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:31,948
If I could have one more sample

49
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,817
No, it's finished.

50
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,085
We're done.

51
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,341
Dad's dead.

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,609
He had a heart attack.

53
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,912
Your father, he was deeply flawed

54
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:04,448
In ways you will never know.

55
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:06,750
I can't believe he's gone.

56
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:11,788
Dad's dead.

57
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,256
Dad?

58
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,893
You're dead.

59
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,128
Dad's dead.

60
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,162
He had a heart attack this morning.

61
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,797
Come give your father a hug.

62
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:27,771
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

63
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,873
No!

64
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:39,082
Take it easy, peter.

65
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:42,052
Your body is still in shock.

66
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:45,889
You took my abilities.

67
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,324
You gave me no choice, son.

68
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:49,526
Are they gone forever?

69
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:50,660
Yes.

70
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:54,164
How am I supposed to believe any of this?

71
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,565
You've been dead for over a year.

72
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,835
Then I find you preaching to some supervillian gang?

73
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:01,071
I'm sorry that I lied to you and your brother,

74
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,909
But I've had to make hard choices for the greater good.

75
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,444
Giving everyone on the planet an ability.

76
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,413
That's really your idea of the greater good?

77
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,580
That's not what I want.

78
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:11,815
That's what happens.

79
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,483
I've seen the future, dad.

80
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,619
I've seen the whole neighborhood get nuked.

81
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,320
You can help me.

82
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:18,688
Together we can make sure that the future you saw

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,856
Never happens.

84
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,992
Once you understand what I'm doing--

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,062
I'm not interested in what you're doing.

86
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:26,363
With or without my powers,

87
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,598
I'm going to find a way to shut you down,

88
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,669
And I'm going to make you pay for everything you've ever done.

89
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,008
Son,

90
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,544
Until you change that attitude,

91
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,548
You're grounded.

92
00:04:57,128 --> 00:05:00,497
You okay?

93
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,733
I think so.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,434
Is that weird?

95
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,770
We just starred in a human puppet show,

96
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,505
My dad is working with a serial killer,

97
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,574
And I can't feel pain.

98
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,443
Claire, the things you deal with,

99
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:16,079
The demons you face, I can't imagine...

100
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,014
How you handle them.

101
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:21,118
That you stay strong in the face of it all.

102
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,987
That makes me proud.

103
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,124
Thanks.

104
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,265
What's wrong with the lights?

105
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:42,439
I'm going to check the circuit breakers.

106
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:44,674
Lyle!

107
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,544
Oh, my god. what happened?

108
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,279
Are you okay?

109
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,114
Bitch is back.

110
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:01,258
Elle?

111
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,631
Hey, cheerleader.

112
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,685
What the hell are you doing here?

113
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,321
Get out of my house.

114
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,189
Not until I get what I came for.

115
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,728
Fine.

116
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,863
Then I'll throw you out!

117
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,234
Leave me alone!

118
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,718
Why are you here?

119
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,587
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,056
I need help.

121
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,295
And I didn't know where else to go.

122
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,157
I apologize for keeping you waiting, doctor.

123
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,559
I'm arthur petrelli.

124
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,697
Everyone thinks you're dead.

125
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,232
That was the idea.

126
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,036
What could possibly drive a father

127
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,907
Have you met their mother?

128
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,542
How is our patient?

129
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,444
Terrified.

130
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,679
She thinks I'm a monster

131
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,348
And has no idea where she is.

132
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,783
Nor do i, for that matter.

133
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,784
You're among friends.

134
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,085
I promised maya

135
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,921
I would remove her abilities and end her suffering.

136
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,591
I will do anything to keep that promise.

137
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,362
All you have to do is watch.

138
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:18,591
Get away from me.

139
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,363
Get him out of here.

140
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,838
You're telling me all traces

141
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,673
Of maya's ability have been removed from her system.

142
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,842
I take it all

143
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,744
And leave nothing behind.

144
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,479
Could you do the same to me?

145
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,347
Is that what you want?

146
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,982
To be normal again?

147
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,487
I injected myself with an unstable formula.

148
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,022
Its side effects are changing me into something else,

149
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,225
Something I don't understand.

150
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,260
I need to find a way to reverse the changes

151
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,596
And retain my abilities.

152
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,715
This isn't my formula.

153
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,551
The cytologies are similar,

154
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,854
But these protein links are enmeshed.

155
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,222
Has it been successful?

156
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,591
We've taken it as far as we can.

157
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,859
That's why we need you.

158
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,897
If you can make our version of the formula successful,

159
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,434
A fresh injection might be exactly what you need.

160
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,571
I've been down this road before.

161
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,573
There is always a hidden agenda.

162
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,309
A self-serving motivation behind it all.

163
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,814
If you don't want to be here, leave.

164
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:59,592
I'll need test subjects.

165
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,594
Gabriel.

166
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,132
Momma.

167
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,833
How are you here? you're sick.

168
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,602
Peter needs your help.

169
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,203
Peter doesn't want anything to do with me,

170
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,738
He thinks I'm just a killer.

171
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,240
This isn't about what he wants.

172
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,809
This is about what I am telling you to do.

173
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,044
Now stop feeling sorry for yourself

174
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,880
And get out of this cell.

175
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,082
This is where I belong...

176
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,384
In a cage.

177
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,319
I couldn't escape even if I wanted to.

178
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,921
They're blocking my abilities.

179
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,323
Then how do you explain my being here?

180
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,528
Oh, gabriel...

181
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,265
You don't know the half of what you're capable of.

182
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,368
Show them.

183
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:18,504
Show them all why you're my favorite.

184
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,442
Make mommy proud.

185
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,626
Don't worry, mom.

186
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,129
I'll save peter.

187
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:51,070
Are you going to be okay?

188
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,072
Yeah, fine.

189
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm leaving.

190
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,720
Is...there something wrong with you?

191
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,356
I can't control it anymore.

192
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,725
I keep overloading.

193
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,961
And I can't eat,

194
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,896
I can't sleep...

195
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,267
This girl found me,

196
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,404
Said I should go to this company, pinehearst.

197
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,638
That they knew what was wrong with me

198
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,840
And how to get me better.

199
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,575
But I've never heard of it.

200
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,877
I didn't want to go there

201
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,011
Without knowing what the deal was.

202
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,780
And your dad,

203
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,283
Your dad always seemed to be the one

204
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:41,087
With the answers.

205
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,790
So home invasion time.

206
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,528
What if there's something wrong with all of us

207
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,797
And they can fix it?

208
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,199
You're fine.

209
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,967
You're perfect.

210
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,638
No, I'm not.

211
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,139
Whatever's happening to you,

212
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,874
It's happening to me, too.

213
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,476
You're still healing, aren't you?

214
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,044
Yeah.

215
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:10,116
But I can't feel pain.

216
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,284
And I think it's only a matter of time

217
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,519
Before I can't feel anything at all.

218
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,488
You can't feel pain.

219
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,623
I wish I had your problems,

220
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,292
Cheerleader.

221
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,294
My body is screaming.

222
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,530
I'm in agony.

223
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,568
Go with me.

224
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,940
If there's a chance that these people

225
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:38,678
At pinehearst can help us, we'll go together.

226
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,051
All right, dorothy.

227
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:48,387
Then we're off to see the wizard.

228
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,331
Daphne.

229
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,299
You have a mess to clean up.

230
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,302
I do?

231
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,671
You were supposed to recruit my son, matt parkman.

232
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,807
Yeah, I gave him the pitch, but he wasn't buying.

233
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,909
I mean, the guy's a mind-reader.

234
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,044
Were you thinking something

235
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,615
Which would discourage him from joining us?

236
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,786
That's not what I meant.

237
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:20,987
She's lying.

238
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:24,924
I am not.

239
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,259
Then why are you so scared?

240
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,766
How can I fix this?

241
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,036
Re-visit mr. parkman.

242
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,105
But I don't think he's going to take the deal.

243
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,973
You're not going there to offer him anything.

244
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,075
You're going there to kill him.

245
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,076
What?

246
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,644
I just asked her to kill your son,

247
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,345
Maury, is that a problem?

248
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,747
You're damn right.

249
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:48,948
My loyalty for his safety.

250
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:52,351
That was the arrangement.

251
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,486
I'm a thieief.

252
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:55,588
I steal things.

253
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,889
There's no way I could kill anybody.

254
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,125
I'm not going to let you do this, arthur.

255
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,060
You're not in a position to give me orders.

256
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,361
I'm matt's father.

257
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,130
Without me, you'd still be lying--

258
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,572
Thank you, maury,

259
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,141
For all your sacrifice.

260
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,748
Please.

261
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,750
There has to be another way.

262
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,284
But you don't know anything about this place.

263
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:36,087
Look, elle needs help and so do i.

264
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,255
This pinehearst place could be our best shot.

265
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,445
Pinehearst, sounds like a dishwashing liquid.

266
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,125
I gotta call your dad.

267
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,397
Mom.

268
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,698
Please don't.

269
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,700
Claire, he loves you.

270
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,402
I know.

271
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,903
But there's something inside of me,

272
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,239
And it's broken.

273
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,342
And he can't fix it.

274
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,177
I think I'm the only one who can.

275
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:05,449
Do you understand that?

276
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,818
Do you really think you can trust elle?

277
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:09,120
No.

278
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,788
But we both want the same thing.

279
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:14,425
We need our abilities under control.

280
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,661
If she gives you any lip,

281
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:19,764
You just toss a glass of water on her...

282
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,198
Lyle style.

283
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,536
This is dr. mohinder suresh.

284
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:26,971
I am not available.

285
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,506
Please leave a message, and I'll call you back.

286
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:30,574
Mohinder, it's matt.

287
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:31,876
Where the hell you been, man?

288
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:34,278
I just got back from the craziest week of my life.

289
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:41,018
Uh, do me a favor, give me a call as soon as possible, okay?

290
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,486
Put down the phone.

291
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:43,487
Daphne.

292
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:46,057
What are you doing?

293
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:48,392
They think that I told you not to come to pinehearst.

294
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,294
That I warned you away.

295
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,963
They don't believe I'm one of them.

296
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,531
-Well, you're not. -shut up.

297
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:55,099
If I don't kill you, they'll kill me.

298
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,405
Shoot.

299
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:03,007
-What? -shoot me.

300
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,475
Go ahead.

301
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,110
If it's the only way that I can save your life, do it.

302
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:08,446
You think you know me,

303
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:12,383
That I'm worth saving, but I've done some bad things.

304
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:13,451
You make up for all that in the future.

305
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:14,885
I don't have a future...

306
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:18,622
Unless I kill you, so...turn around.

307
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,326
Do it.

308
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:34,305
We get married.

309
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:37,775
We start a family together.

310
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:39,777
Stop it.

311
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,746
We're going to love each other.

312
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,264
I'm sorry, matt.

313
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:05,169
It happened so fast, there was nothing I could do.

314
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,912
My dad?

315
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,269
So I guess you're not going to help.

316
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:39,503
Don't do this, dad.

317
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,805
Please, you're going to destroy the world.

318
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,139
I don't see it that way.

319
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,108
You think you're better than everyone else?

320
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,676
That you have the right to do whatever you want?

321
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,511
Hurt anyone that gets in your way?

322
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:48,612
I am better, peter.

323
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,147
It's not a belief, it's a fact.

324
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:53,250
And one way or another, you will help me get this done.

325
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:11,802
Suresh.

326
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,204
Hello, peter.

327
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:15,039
So you're helping my father.

328
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,108
I prefer to think he's helping me.

329
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,743
And what is that?

330
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:23,447
Your metabolism is primed to accept abilities.

331
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,416
Which makes you the ideal test case

332
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,319
For a new version of the formula.I need to perfect it.

333
00:20:28,387 --> 00:20:29,553
Wait, wait, wait, when I saw you in the future,

334
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:31,455
You said that manipulating abilities was wrong.

335
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,690
That this was all a mistake.

336
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:33,824
Did i?

337
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:37,028
You were trying to help me, mohinder.

338
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,229
You need to tell me something,

339
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,231
In this future of yours...

340
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,401
What do I look like?

341
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,038
There was something wrong with you.

342
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,439
You changed.

343
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:51,909
You looked like a monster.

344
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:56,447
Then you're too late.

345
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,084
Suresh, no.

346
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,956
Hello, mohinder.

347
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,634
You came for me?

348
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:19,603
That's what brothers do, peter.

349
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:21,973
They look out for each other.

350
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,941
Even after I locked you up?

351
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,710
Let's get out of here.

352
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:29,847
Stop, leave him alone!

353
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,749
He deserves to die.

354
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:33,217
Peter.

355
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:40,391
This is for killing my father.

356
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:41,726
That's enough.

357
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:42,893
Enough!

358
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,261
Do you know who this man is?

359
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:46,230
Do you have any idea

360
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:47,264
How many innocent people he's killed?

361
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:50,501
I do. but he's also my son.

362
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:56,440
And I've been waiting for him for a long time.

363
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:04,230
It's been hours.

364
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:06,532
Who'd you talk to over there?

365
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,334
Some guy from the company.

366
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:10,670
He can keep a secret, right?

367
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:12,471
I hope so.

368
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,076
Do you think they're alive?

369
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:21,113
Do you think they're human?

370
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,316
What if they can't breathe?

371
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,084
Tracy...

372
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,621
We need to help them.

373
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,489
Be careful.

374
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,859
Oh, god.

375
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,264
It's too tough.

376
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,312
I told you not to touch anything.

377
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,882
You.

378
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,917
Meredith.

379
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,352
Nathan.

380
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:04,156
Well, I see you've still got a weakness for blondes.

381
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,637
Everything all right?

382
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,873
I'm what some people would refer to

383
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:23,409
As an anxious flyer.

384
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:29,548
Big tough company agent can't handle being 30,000 feet up?

385
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:34,020
Yeah, well I was never a very good agent.

386
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:35,655
So I read.

387
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:39,125
You, uh, let all those villains escape level five, right?

388
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:41,961
Shut up.

389
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,062
Yeah, I caught doyle.

390
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,530
I helped clean up your mess.

391
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:45,998
Doyle?

392
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,067
Yeah, the freak with the puppets.

393
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,302
This agent thing isn't so hard.

394
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,904
You know, my father pushed me in to this life.

395
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,239
I wanted no part of it.

396
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,307
And if you do, you're an idiot.

397
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:55,341
Elle.

398
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,443
You have no idea how good you have it.

399
00:24:01,615 --> 00:24:03,215
This is your captain speaking.

400
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:04,383
We'd like to remind our passengers

401
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,352
To turn off all electrical equipment.

402
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,421
Thank you.

403
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,090
I think he's talking about you. shut up!

404
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,827
Seriously, calm down.

405
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:17,296
You have to turn it off or we're going to crash.

406
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:18,431
If I knew how to do that,

407
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,866
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

408
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,479
Take my hand.

409
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:34,714
Let me help you.

410
00:24:34,781 --> 00:24:35,982
Dump your electricity into me.

411
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,584
Do it!

412
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,714
We did it.

413
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:13,386
Do you mind?

414
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,432
My dad and I weren't even close.

415
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,068
To think that he would ever put himself In danger to protect me...

416
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,803
Well, he didn't do it, so you can sit

417
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:31,837
Around here and wait to get killed.

418
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,005
What do you mean?

419
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,007
Pinehearst.

420
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,609
They'll be sending someone after me

421
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,843
To make sure you're dead.

422
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,111
Let them come.

423
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,913
Mm, yeah. great.

424
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,515
You're going to use your brain mojo thingy.

425
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,549
Perfect.

426
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:45,384
If you need to go, I understand.

427
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:47,853
But I can't let them get away with this.

428
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,224
I wanna help you. I'm just scared.

429
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,726
So am i.

430
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:56,896
But we can't let our fears stop us from doing what's right.

431
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,103
I knew you couldn't kill him.

432
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,705
I'm sorry, matt.

433
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,039
No, stick to the plan.

434
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,908
Your fear is making me strong, girl.

435
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:09,942
I can't.

436
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,143
No.

437
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,647
No!

438
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:15,982
Stop.

439
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,119
You think you can hold me

440
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,420
With a power?

441
00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:24,357
Not only can I hold you, I can kill you.

442
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:27,393
I'm going to dig inside your head,

443
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,330
Find your worst fear, and make it eat you alive.

444
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,534
I'm not the one that's scared.

445
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:37,303
You are.

446
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:40,506
And your fear just makes me strong.

447
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,833
Matt...

448
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:27,236
That was amazing.

449
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,239
Yeah, well you know,

450
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:32,241
I got inside his head with my brain mojo thingy.

451
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,945
My dad could do the same thing.

452
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:37,346
Now that they think that we're dead,

453
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:38,480
We have time to get away.

454
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:39,615
No.

455
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:41,183
I told you, I'm not running.

456
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,284
What are you going to do, matt?

457
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:43,986
Fight them?

458
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,321
Trick them into killing each other?

459
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:47,256
That's not going to bring your dad back.

460
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:48,557
But it will probably get you killed.

461
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,758
I'm a cop.

462
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:51,794
Stopping guys like knox, that's what I do.

463
00:27:51,861 --> 00:27:52,895
You can't bring them down by yourself.

464
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,129
There's no way.

465
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:57,299
Even with me at your back, we still need help.

466
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:00,436
There's a company, primatech.

467
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:01,837
They know how to deal with situations like this.

468
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:04,073
If anybody can help, they can.

469
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:09,778
Building sealed up tight.

470
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:11,614
If peter's still here, he ain't getting out.

471
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:13,582
Peter's long gone.

472
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,952
If I find him, do you want him crispy or well-done?

473
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,387
Alive, please.

474
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,661
I sent somebody to recruit you,

475
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:28,864
When you refused her offer, I didn't expect to see you here.

476
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:30,566
My mother's in a coma. did you do that?

477
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:33,769
Angela's not the woman you think she is, gabriel.

478
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,137
She's done terrible things.

479
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,573
So have i, and I'm going to do them all to you.

480
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:40,743
Has angela forgiven your sins?

481
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,212
My mother accepts me for who I am.

482
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,481
I wonder if you'll be so generous.

483
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:49,084
What are you talking about?

484
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:50,152
She sent you here, didn't she?

485
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,587
To save her favorite son.

486
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:54,657
Did she tell you that you were all

487
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:56,725
Going to live happily ever after?

488
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:59,094
She's using you, son, as a weapon.

489
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:01,163
A blunt instrument

490
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:04,133
To be manipulated and then discarded.

491
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,735
My mother loves me.

492
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:08,137
When you were born, she had one of her dreams.

493
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,571
A vision of the future.

494
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:10,673
She saw what you would become--

495
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,707
Yeah, I know this.

496
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:12,741
She told me I'd become a hero.

497
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,610
Did she?

498
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:16,745
Angela was so terrified of what she saw,

499
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:18,814
So frightened of her own flesh and blood,

500
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,849
That she tried to kill you.

501
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:24,420
Imagine that, a mother wanting to murder her own child.

502
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:30,759
I got to the bathroom just in time.

503
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,329
She was holding you at the bottom of the tub.

504
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,602
It's time you learned the truth about your mother.

505
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:10,432
That's...

506
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,800
Far enough.

507
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:15,638
I was told you were leaving.

508
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:17,473
Maybe one day I could forgive you,

509
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,644
But after everything that's happened,

510
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:25,114
I just...i don't think I could ever trust you.

511
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:27,650
I know it's hard to believe,

512
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:30,686
But I was trying to help.

513
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:33,689
My feelings for you were real.

514
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,057
Those feelings are still there.

515
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,861
What you did in my name was wrong.

516
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:41,297
I wish I could take it all back.

517
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:44,099
I've done bad things, killed people...

518
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,734
Not by choice, but still...

519
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,237
I did them.

520
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:52,775
I need to make amends.

521
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:55,678
And so do you.

522
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:57,346
Get well, mohinder.

523
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,600
Ah! hold on.

524
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,002
We're almost there. you all right?

525
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:22,705
Thank you.

526
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:24,340
For what?

527
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:26,742
For helping me.

528
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,010
I've been nothing but a bitch.

529
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,111
And you've been nothing but sweet.

530
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,846
Really just makes me hate you more.

531
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:33,082
No, I should be the one thanking you.

532
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,416
Why?

533
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:37,052
Because I was ready to give up.

534
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,289
Stay home, deny everything that's been happening to me.

535
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,325
I was scared.

536
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:45,728
Scared of what?

537
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:48,964
What I would find out about who I really am.

538
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,633
It's just...

539
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,435
It's nice to know that you're as messed up as I am.

540
00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:00,309
Peter, you stayed?

541
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,844
I wasn't going to leave you.

542
00:32:01,911 --> 00:32:02,911
what are you doing sitting here?

543
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:03,979
Did he take your powers?

544
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,114
No, he told me the truth.

545
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:06,148
You can't listen to him.

546
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,616
But he's our father.

547
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,318
He's my father. I grew up with him.

548
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,519
Oh, and I didn't, so I don't get the right to know him.

549
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:11,654
Is that what you're saying?

550
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,289
He can't be trusted.

551
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:15,190
You've seen what he's done.

552
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:16,258
He hurt mom.

553
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:17,393
He's manipulated abilities,

554
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,560
I know where that leads.

555
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:19,728
The world you saw

556
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,664
Doesn't exist.

557
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,965
We won't let it.

558
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:24,533
I'm sorry, peter, this is something I have to do.

559
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:25,768
You help him, and you're proving

560
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:27,036
All the worst things I've ever said about you.

561
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:28,604
Just kick his ass and let's get out of here.

562
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,073
No, I'm not going anywhere, peter.

563
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,942
You are.

564
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,138
Oh, my god, peter!

565
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:48,341
Peter.

566
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:49,776
What are you doing here?

567
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,411
Why are you bleeding?

568
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,079
He's not healing.

569
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,381
He took my ability. we need to go.

570
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,219
Elle, help me

571
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:01,721
Get him in the car.

572
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,623
Claire...

573
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,724
Did you hear what he said?

574
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:05,725
That they took his ability.

575
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:07,093
That's what we came here for.

576
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,496
You don't know what happened up there.

577
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:12,966
I'm sorry, claire.

578
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,033
Elle!

579
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:19,973
If you can't heal,

580
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:21,574
How did you fall that far and not die?

581
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:23,510
I don't know.

582
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:27,514
Okay, let me get this straight.

583
00:33:27,615 --> 00:33:29,182
She's the biological mother

584
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,517
Of your illegitimate daughter,

585
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:33,153
And he's her adopted father.

586
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,889
That sounds about right.

587
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,361
Did suresh inject you with anything?

588
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:43,062
Yeah, a tranquilizer, why?

589
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:45,799
What's he doing in there?

590
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,667
Building a nest.

591
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,170
Laying eggs. who the hell knows?

592
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,671
You're both going to have to come into the company

593
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,006
To be tested. for what?

594
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,975
Just to be sure you're still normal.

595
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,860
So you're working with him?

596
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,295
For now.

597
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,965
Excuse me.

598
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,067
Petrelli.

599
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:26,039
I'd watch out for that one.

600
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,441
Oh, we're not together.

601
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:34,948
Claire?

602
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,716
Slow down, slow down.

603
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,651
Where are you?

604
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,654
No, I won't tell anyone.

605
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,325
Peter's never going to give up, you know.

606
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:48,962
I would expect nothing less of a petrelli.

607
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:51,631
Revenge is in our blood.

608
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,434
We're just gonna wait for him to come after us.

609
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:55,869
No, son.

610
00:34:55,936 --> 00:35:00,373
We're going to take our fight to the enemy.

611
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:03,309
How do you suppose peter survived that fall?

612
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:06,546
Seven stories without the ability to heal.

613
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:09,449
Hell of a thing.

614
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,486
I don't know.

615
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:19,993
It worked.

616
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,728
He thinks I'm on his side.

617
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,062
Good job.

618
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,264
If he reaches out to primatech,

619
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:25,999
I'll let you know what they say.

620
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:29,202
Screw this up,

621
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,039
And I'll put you right back where I found you.

622
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,264
I keep thinking about that fall.

623
00:35:58,332 --> 00:35:59,666
How I didn't hit as hard as I should have.

624
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:03,269
What if sylar didn't want me to die?

625
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:04,304
What if...

626
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,873
He wanted to get me out of there alive?

627
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,808
By throwing you out of a window?

628
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:11,177
No, he could have used his ability to slow me down.

629
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:15,315
I'm telling you he saved my life, claire.

630
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,785
Claire.

631
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,526
It's all right. she's good.

632
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:28,394
What happened?

633
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:33,533
Why aren't you healing?

634
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,735
I don't have my powers anymore, nathan.

635
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:42,675
Dad took 'em.

636
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:43,743
Dad's dead.

637
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:45,578
He's not, he's alive.

638
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,414
I was there, pete. I saw it--

639
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:51,184
He's alive, nathan.

640
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,352
And if we don't do something to stop him,

641
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,320
He's going to kill us all.

642
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,646
That's just-- that's impossible, pete.

643
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:03,815
Dad died over a year ago.

644
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,789
He's the one who put mom in that coma.

645
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,925
Pete, this is our dad we're talking about here.

646
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:19,330
Believe me, dads aren't always what they seem.

647
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,404
Where is he? stay away from him.

648
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:28,306
He's dangerous, nathan.

649
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:29,874
Look what he did to me.

650
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:31,576
If our father's alive,

651
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:33,778
I need to know where he is.

652
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,814
What's the name of the company?

653
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,018
Pinehearst.

654
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:45,056
Pinehearst, the bio-tech firm?

655
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,491
No, I'm not going to let you do this.

656
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,559
Nathan...

657
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,195
Trust me.

658
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:52,797
Please. okay.

659
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:55,033
We'll do it your way.

660
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:57,930
There's a lot of ways to shut pinehearst down.

661
00:37:57,936 --> 00:38:01,660
I'll go call somebody up from the justice department.

662
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:02,507
We'll get some help.

663
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,560
You're not going to listen to a word he just said, are you?

664
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,582
Nope,

665
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,457
I'm going to see my father.

666
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:22,126
How do you know about pinehearst?

667
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:24,329
I've been taking a consultant fee

668
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:25,886
From them for over a year.

669
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,665
I'm coming with you.

670
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:30,708
I know the players there, I can open doors.

671
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,512
I don't need any doors opened.

672
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:35,874
I plan on kicking them down.

673
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:43,581
Is that food?

674
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:44,816
It's a recipe.

675
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,685
It's been in my family for thousands of years.

676
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:52,457
You refuse to go back in time.

677
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:54,993
Even if it means saving the world.

678
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:56,728
I cannot risk changing history.

679
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,062
If only there is some other way

680
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,632
Of learning about my enemies.

681
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:03,535
Uncovering their weak spots, so I can defeat them.

682
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,436
For thousands of years, my family

683
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:07,171
Have taken spirit walks.

684
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,873
Following destiny's path

685
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:13,044
Into the realms of the unconsciousness.

686
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:29,427
Delicious.

687
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:32,263
Spirit walk sounds much safer

688
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:34,432
Than time traveling.

689
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,801
Okay...

690
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:38,636
I'm ready to begin my journey.

691
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:40,038
How do I start?

692
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:41,606
You eat a disgusting paste

693
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:44,442
Made from the roots of a tamboti tree.

694
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,978
And the dung of hyena.

695
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,053
And then?

696
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,022
You wait.

697
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,467
Hiro!

698
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,302
Hiro!

699
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,805


700
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:14,372
You tricked him.

701
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,840
I warned him.

702
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:16,975
If he did not choose his path,

703
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,743
It would be chosen for him.

704
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:19,844
Hiro.

705
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:21,045
Hiro.

706
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:22,213
He's going to wake up, right?

707
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,115
He's going to be okay?

708
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:27,485
Hiro - hiro, hiro!

709
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,621
Hiro!
